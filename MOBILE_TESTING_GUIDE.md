## Alternative Methods

### Method 2: Build APK for Testing

#### Prerequisites
- Create a free EAS account at https://expo.dev/signup
- Install EAS CLI: `npm install -g eas-cli`

#### Build APK
```bash
# Login to EAS
eas login

# Configure your project
eas build:configure

# Build APK for Android
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

This will build an APK file you can download and install directly on your Android device.

### Method 3: Expo Development Build

For advanced features that require native code:

```bash
# Build development client
eas build --platform android --profile development

# Install the development build on your device
# Then run:
npx expo start --dev-client
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Metro bundler not found"**: Run `npx expo start --clear`

2. **QR Code not working**: 
   - Ensure both devices are on the same WiFi network
   - Try the tunnel mode: `npx expo start --tunnel`

3. **Dependencies missing**:
   ```bash
   cd mobile
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

4. **App crashes on device**:
   - Check the Expo Go app logs
   - Ensure all native dependencies are properly configured
