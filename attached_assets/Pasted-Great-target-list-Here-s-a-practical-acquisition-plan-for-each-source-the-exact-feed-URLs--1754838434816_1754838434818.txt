Great target list. Here’s a **practical acquisition plan** for each source + the **exact feed URLs (where they exist)** and **fallback tactics** when they don’t. I also give you a **single JSON block** you can drop into your app to seed your fetcher.

---

# Strategy + Feed Endpoints

## 1) FTC Consumer Alerts — **Primary**

* **How**: Use FTC’s public RSS hub.
* **Feeds** (pick at least these two):

  * Consumer Blog (alerts/how-tos): [https://www.ftc.gov/stay-connected/rss](https://www.ftc.gov/stay-connected/rss)
  * Consumer Protection Press Releases (RSS item on page). ([Federal Trade Commission][1])

## 2) FBI IC3 Alerts — **Primary**

* **How**: IC3 PSAs page exposes RSS.
* **Feed**: (via page) [https://www.ic3.gov/PSA](https://www.ic3.gov/PSA)  → click RSS icon (same for CSA). ([Internet Crime Complaint Center][2])

## 3) Social Security Administration (SSA/OIG) — **Primary**

* **How**: Use OIG’s RSS page + “Scam Alerts” listing.
* **Feeds**: [https://oig.ssa.gov/rss/](https://oig.ssa.gov/rss/) (News Releases RSS; pair with Scam Alerts page polling). ([oig.ssa.gov][3])

## 4) HHS-OIG Consumer Alerts (Medicare/health) — **Primary**

* **How**: Poll “Consumer Alerts” and “Special Fraud Alerts” pages (RSS not always exposed; cadence steady).
* **Pages**: [https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/consumer-alerts/](https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/consumer-alerts/) and [https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/alerts/](https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/alerts/) (some sections have RSS; if not, scrape + diff). ([Office of Inspector General][4])

## 5) CISA Cybersecurity Advisories — **Context / trend**

* **How**: CISA publishes public RSS endpoints (news, blog, advisories, ICS).
* **Feeds**:

  * News: [https://www.cisa.gov/news.xml](https://www.cisa.gov/news.xml)
  * Blog: [https://www.cisa.gov/cisa/blog.xml](https://www.cisa.gov/cisa/blog.xml)
  * Advisories (all): [https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-advisories/all.xml](https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-advisories/all.xml)
  * ICS: [https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-advisories/ics-advisories.xml](https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-advisories/ics-advisories.xml) (and /ics-medical-advisories.xml). ([CISA][5])

## 6) SEC Investor Alerts — **Primary for investment scams**

* **How**: Investor.gov alerts page exposes RSS.
* **Feed**: from page [https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins) (RSS link on page). ([Investor.gov][6])

## 7) CFPB Consumer Protection — **Primary**

* **How**: CFPB blog has RSS; newsroom too.
* **Feeds**:

  * Blog: (RSS link on page) [https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/)
  * Newsroom (optional): [https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/) (RSS link on page). ([Consumer Financial Protection Bureau][7])

## 8) FCC Consumer Alerts — **Primary (phone/text scams)**

* **How**: FCC maintains an RSS directory; pick “Consumer” feeds.
* **Hub**: [https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/rss-feeds-and-email-updates-fcc](https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/rss-feeds-and-email-updates-fcc)
* **Context pages**: fraud/robocall guides. ([Federal Communications Commission][8])

## 9) DOJ Consumer Protection — **Mixed cadence, still useful**

* **How**: Use DOJ Civil Division / Consumer Protection Branch press room + USAO feeds.
* **Feeds/Pages**:

  * CPB Press Releases page (subscribe/email; some sections provide RSS via Civil Division press room). [https://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch-press-releases](https://www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch-press-releases)
  * USAO RSS directory (per district): [https://www.justice.gov/usao/rss](https://www.justice.gov/usao/rss)
    *(Note: DOJ has been restructuring CPB; keep these but weight lower.)* ([Department of Justice][9], [Reuters][10])

## 10) AARP Fraud Watch — **.org, very relevant**

* **How**: AARP press center provides RSS; Fraud Watch items appear there. (Fraud Watch Network itself doesn’t expose a clean global RSS.)
* **Feed**: [https://press.aarp.org/rss](https://press.aarp.org/rss) ([MediaRoom][11])

## 11) BBB Scam Tracker — **.org, high value**

* **How**: No universal public RSS/API for Scam Tracker; two approaches:

  * Poll “Latest Scams news” (national): [https://www.bbb.org/us/news/scams](https://www.bbb.org/us/news/scams)
  * Regional BBB sites often have “Scam Alerts” pages you can poll; enrich with links to Scam Tracker detail items.
* *(Treat as scrape-with-diff; respect robots.txt and cadence.)* ([Better Business Bureau][12])

## 12) Treasury FinCEN — **Mixed, more B2B but good signals**

* **How**: No obvious global RSS; poll News + Advisories pages and diff.
* **Pages**:

  * Newsroom: [https://www.fincen.gov/news-room/news](https://www.fincen.gov/news-room/news)
  * Advisories/Bulletins/Fact Sheets: [https://www.fincen.gov/resources/advisoriesbulletinsfact-sheets](https://www.fincen.gov/resources/advisoriesbulletinsfact-sheets)
    *(Good for “red flags” your model can translate for consumers.)* ([FinCEN.gov][13])

## 13) Medicare Fraud Alerts (CMS/Medicare.gov) — **Primary for older adults**

* **How**: CMS Fraud pages don’t expose a clean RSS; poll CMS fraud hub + Medicare fraud guidance pages and diff.
* **Pages**:

  * CMS Fraud Hub: [https://www.cms.gov/fraud](https://www.cms.gov/fraud)
  * Medicare.gov reporting page (evergreen resource): [https://www.medicare.gov/basics/reporting-medicare-fraud-and-abuse](https://www.medicare.gov/basics/reporting-medicare-fraud-and-abuse)
    *(If you must have an RSS, pair with HHS-OIG Consumer Alerts above.)* ([CMS][14], [Medicare][15])

## Implementation notes (so this “just works”)

* **Fetcher**: for `type: rss`, fetch XML; for `poll`, fetch HTML and extract new cards with date/title/URL; for `rss-directory`, crawl the page and capture each sub-feed URL once.
* **De-dupe**: hash on `(normalized_title + domain + yyyymmdd)`; keep the most “consumer-plain-English” version.
* **Tagging**: add simple keyword flags (`irs`, `ssa`, `medicare`, `gift card`, `crypto`, `romance`, `grandparent`, `utility`, `package`, `invoice`, `warranty`).
* **Ranking**: FTC/IC3/HHS-OIG/CFPB/FCC get top priority for seniors; CISA/SEC/FinCEN are secondary context unless item mentions consumers directly.
* **Compliance**: follow robots.txt; respect `Cache-Control`; backoff on 429; crawl 1–2/minute per domain max.

If you want, I’ll wire these into your existing Replit worker and output a single `alerts.json` you can hit from Boomer Buddy by morning.
