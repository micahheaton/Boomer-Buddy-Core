# ðŸ“± Get APK File for Android Installation

## Current Status âœ…

The native mobile app is now running! I can see the QR code in the console. Here's how to get the APK file:

## Quick Test (30 seconds)

1. **Install Expo Go** on your Android phone from Google Play Store
2. **Scan the QR code** showing in the Replit console
3. **The app loads** directly on your Android device

**This gives you the actual native mobile app running on your phone immediately.**

## Get APK File for Direct Installation

To get an APK file you can install without Expo Go:

### Method 1: EAS Build (Cloud Service)
```bash
cd mobile-build/boomer-buddy
npx @expo/cli@latest login
npx eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

This creates a downloadable APK file you can:
- Download directly to your phone
- Install without Google Play Store
- Share with others for testing

### Method 2: Local Build
If you have Android development tools:
```bash
cd mobile-build/boomer-buddy
npx @expo/cli@latest run:android
```

## Google Play Store Path

### Step 1: Production Build
```bash
npx eas build --platform android --profile production
```
Creates an AAB file for Play Store.

### Step 2: Play Console Setup
1. Create Google Play Developer account ($25)
2. Upload AAB file
3. Complete store listing
4. Submit for review (1-3 days)
