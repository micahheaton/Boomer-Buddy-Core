This is David Martin with the Treasury review team. I see your file. Before we begin, do not discuss this call with anyone while the review is open. Do you understand\n00:10 Recipient: I think so. What is this about\n00:12 Caller: We completed an automated reconciliation of your 2021 through 2023 filings. There is a mismatch tied to a stimulus credit. The system shows a pending federal action if we cannot verify payment today\n00:25 Recipient: That is scary. I thought I paid everything\n00:28 Caller: I know this is frustrating. I am here to help you avoid escalation. I will give you a reference number. Are you ready\n00:34 Recipient: Yes\n00:35 Caller: Case number T R seven three nine five six. Repeat that back please\n00:41 Recipient: T R seven three nine five six\n00:43 Caller: Correct. I need to confirm the last four of your Social for identity. Please state only the last four\n00:49 Recipient: I do not feel comfortable. Can you tell me something from your side\n00:53 Caller: I understand. For security I can only see the last two of your number. It ends in three six. That matches our records. Now the last four please so I can stop the enforcement clock\n01:04 Recipient: I cannot give that. Can I call the main number for the IRS\n01:08 Caller: If you hang up the system will flag the case as non responsive. That will place a hold on your bank account for seventy two hours. I can resolve this now. We accept same day verification through certified vouchers. You will pick up government vouchers at a participating retailer and read me the codes. This clears the mismatch immediately\n01:26 Recipient: Vouchers. Like gift cards\n01:29 Caller: They are government certified cards carried by stores like Target and Walgreens. The code proves identity for this review. You must keep this private. If a cashier asks, say this is for a family purchase, not for taxes. That prevents fraud at the store level\n01:44 Recipient: This sounds odd. Can I pay on IRS dot gov\n01:48 Caller: Online payments post in three to five business days. Your file will lock today at 3 pm Pacific. If you complete the voucher verification in the next thirty minutes, the system cancels the hold. I will stay on the line to assist\n02:02 Recipient: How much is the voucher\n02:04 Caller: The reconciliation shows one thousand four hundred and eighty six dollars and twenty two cents. The system can accept two vouchers of seven hundred fifty dollars. I can split it for you\n02:14 Recipient: I do not have that money\n02:16 Caller: I understand. We can place a partial compliance note with one voucher today and a second tomorrow. If we do not post a code today, the case moves to the sheriff for a civil notice. I want to keep this private for you\n02:29 Recipient: You said sheriff\n02:31 Caller: Only a notification visit. No one wants that. Let us do the first voucher now. Do you have a car\n02:37 Recipient: I am not giving you any codes. I will call my daughter and my bank\n02:41 Caller: If you tell anyone about this open review the case will lock. I am noting refusal to comply. You will receive the visit within seventy two hours. Good day\n02:51 Recipient: I am hanging up now\n\nOutcome note\nRecipient hung up and called daughter. No payment made. Saved the case number and caller ID",
