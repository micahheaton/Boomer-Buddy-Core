### üöß IN PROGRESS: Backend API Implementation

**Required Endpoints** (¬ß10, ¬ß13)
- ‚è≥ `/v1/model` - Model metadata and CDN URLs
- ‚è≥ `/v1/analyze` - Feature vector analysis (stateless)
- ‚è≥ `/v1/feeds.json` - Government data aggregation
- ‚è≥ Stateless, logless architecture
- ‚è≥ Memory-only processing

### üöß PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED: Storage Architecture

**StorageService Updates Needed**
- ‚è≥ Encrypted SQLite for evidence storage
- ‚è≥ Training profile and spaced repetition data
- ‚è≥ Call/SMS screening logs
- ‚è≥ Cache management for models and feeds

### ‚è≥ PENDING: Integration & Testing

**Cross-Service Integration**
- ‚è≥ Native extensions calling React Native bridge
- ‚è≥ Real-time data flow between services
- ‚è≥ Background processing coordination
- ‚è≥ Permission management

**Testing Requirements** (¬ß16)
- ‚è≥ Unit tests for PII scrubber, risk engine, training
- ‚è≥ Integration tests for native extensions
- ‚è≥ E2E tests for evidence capture and export
- ‚è≥ Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Key Architectural Decisions Implemented

### 1. Zero-PII Guarantee
- **Hard Blocks**: SSN, PAN detection prevents any transmission
- **Feature Vectors**: Only metadata transmitted, never raw content
- **Local Processing**: All sensitive operations on-device only
- **Validation**: Double-checking before any network transmission

### 2. Platform-Specific Approach
- **Android**: CallScreeningService for real-time interception
- **iOS**: Call Directory Extension for system-level integration
- **Cross-Platform**: React Native bridge for shared business logic

### 3. Privacy-First Design
- **Local Storage**: All evidence encrypted locally
- **No Cloud Storage**: User controls all data backup
- **Minimal Metadata**: Only aggregate statistics if needed
- **User Control**: Complete data deletion capabilities

### 4. Senior-Friendly UX
- **30-Second Interactions**: Micro-drills respect attention spans
- **Voice Integration**: Accessibility for vision/mobility issues
- **Simple Language**: All explanations in everyday terms
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time protection without complexity

## Implementation Gaps Identified

### 1. Missing from Original Specification
The following were implemented but NOT in your specification:
- ‚ùå Location Safety Mapping
- ‚ùå Risk Assessment Quiz UI
- ‚ùå Voice Alert System
- ‚ùå Family Monitoring Dashboard
