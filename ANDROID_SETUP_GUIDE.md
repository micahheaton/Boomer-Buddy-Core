# ðŸš€ Android APK Build Guide - Boomer Buddy Mobile

## Current Status

The mobile app code exists but has dependency conflicts preventing direct builds in this environment. Here's how to get the actual APK on your Android device:

## Option 1: EAS Build Service (Recommended)

### Step 1: Setup
```bash
cd mobile
npm install -g @expo/cli eas-cli
eas login
```

### Step 2: Configure Project
```bash
eas build:configure
```

### Step 3: Build APK
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```
This creates a downloadable APK file you can install directly on your Android.

### Step 4: Download & Install
- EAS provides a download link
- Download the APK to your phone
- Enable "Install from unknown sources" in Android settings
- Install the APK

## Option 2: Local Build (If you have Android Studio)

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio installed
- Android SDK configured
- Java JDK 11+

### Commands
```bash
cd mobile
expo run:android
```

## Option 3: Expo Development Build

### Step 1: Install Expo Dev Client
```bash
cd mobile
expo install expo-dev-client
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

### Step 2: Install Development APK
- Download the development build APK
- Install on your Android device
- Run `expo start --dev-client` to connect

## Google Play Store Deployment Path

### Step 1: Production Build
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production
```
This creates an AAB (Android App Bundle) file.

### Step 2: Google Play Console
1. Create Google Play Developer account ($25 one-time fee)
2. Create new app in Play Console
3. Upload the AAB file
4. Complete store listing (description, screenshots, etc.)
5. Submit for review

### Step 3: Release Process
- Internal testing â†’ Closed testing â†’ Open testing â†’ Production
- Google reviews typically take 1-3 days
- Once approved, app is live on Play Store

## What's Included in the Mobile App

âœ… **Native React Native App** (not web wrapper)  
âœ… **Zero-PII Architecture** with on-device processing  
âœ… **Scam Analysis Engine** with image upload  
âœ… **Emergency Features** for immediate threat response  
âœ… **Live Government Data** from 60+ official sources  
âœ… **Training Modules** for scam detection skills  
âœ… **Offline Capabilities** for core features  
âœ… **Push Notifications** for critical alerts  

## Current Challenge

The dependency conflicts in this environment prevent building immediately. The recommended path is:

1. **Use EAS Build Service** (cloud-based, works around local issues)
2. **Download APK directly** to your Android device
3. **Test immediately** without development environment setup

Would you like me to help set up the EAS build process to get you the APK file?
